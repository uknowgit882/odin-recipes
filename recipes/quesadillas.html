    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Quesadillas are a beloved staple of Mexican cuisine, known for their crispy tortilla exterior and warm, cheesy filling. Traditionally made with corn tortillas and Oaxaca cheese, quesadillas have evolved over time to include a variety of fillings like beans, vegetables, meats, and spices. Theyâ€™re typically cooked on a griddle, or "comal," until the outside is golden and the cheese inside is irresistibly melted. Easy to customize and quick to prepare, quesadillas are perfect for a casual meal, a midday snack, or a satisfying appetizer.

            The origin of quesadillas dates back to colonial Mexico, where indigenous culinary traditions blended with Spanish influences. Early versions were likely simple just tortillas filled with cheese or squash blossoms reflecting the ingredients available at the time. As regional flavors developed, so did the quesadilla, with each area of Mexico adding its own twist. Today, quesadillas are enjoyed around the world and continue to adapt, from street food stalls in Mexico City to home kitchens everywhere, proving that good food never goes out of style.
