        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Injera is a staple of Ethiopian and Eritrean cuisine, known for its unique texture and slightly tangy flavor. This spongy flatbread is traditionally made from teff flour, a naturally gluten-free ancient grain, and is cooked on a large, flat griddle. What makes injera special is not just its taste, but its role at the table, it serves as both a plate and a utensil. Various stews, lentils, and vegetables, known collectively as wat, are served on top of the injera, and pieces are torn off to scoop up the food by hand, making every meal a shared, hands-on experience.

                The history of injera dates back thousands of years, deeply rooted in the highlands of Ethiopia where teff was first cultivated. As one of the oldest domesticated grains, teff has long sustained communities with its resilience and nutritional value. Over generations, the fermentation process used to make injera became a defining element, not only enhancing its flavor but also aiding in digestion. Today, injera remains central to Ethiopian and Eritrean culture, symbolizing hospitality, tradition, and the importance of communal dining.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat a large cast-iron skillet over a medium flame. Mix the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, baking powder and salt together in a large bowl. Stir in the club soda and mix to a smooth batter. It should have the thin consistency of a pancake batter.</li>
                <li>Wipe the skillet with a little oil using a paper towel. Ladle about 1/2 cup of the batter into the skillet and spread it with a spatula to make a large crepe. Let bake in the skillet until all the bubbles on top burst and begin to dry out, about 2 or 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Carefully turn the injera over and cook on second side another minute or two. Try not to brown it too much.</li>
                <li>Remove the injera to a warm platter and repeat with the rest of the batter, wiping the skillet clean with an oiled paper towel each time.</li>
                <li>After the batter is used up, use a pastry brush to brush each injera with the lemon juice. Serve immediately or hold covered in a warm oven.</li>
